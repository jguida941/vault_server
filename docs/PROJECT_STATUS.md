## Technical Architecture

### Current Implementation
```
Frontend (working.html/player.html)
    ↓
Browser LocalStorage (permanent storage)
    ↓
YouTube Embed API (no-cookie version)
```

### Data Flow
1. User adds video → Stored in LocalStorage
2. Player loads → Reads from LocalStorage
3. Video plays → YouTube iframe embed
4. No server-side storage needed

## Memory Usage Analysis

### Why It's Lightweight

1. **No Video Storage**: The vault ONLY stores metadata:
   ```javascript
   {
     id: "ALimx-H8C6s",      // 11 characters
     title: "Song Name",      // ~20-50 characters
     category: "Hip Hop",     // ~10-20 characters
     isPrivate: false,        // boolean
     addedDate: 1753192022069 // timestamp
   }
   ```
   Total per video: ~100-200 bytes

2. **YouTube Handles Everything**:
   - Video streaming comes from YouTube servers
   - No video data stored locally
   - Only one video loaded at a time
   - Previous videos are unloaded from memory

3. **LocalStorage Limits**:
   - Browsers allow 5-10MB for LocalStorage
   - At 200 bytes per video, you can store 25,000-50,000 videos
   - Categories add minimal overhead

4. **Memory Usage Over Time**:
   - Adding 100 videos = ~20KB
   - Adding 1,000 videos = ~200KB
   - Adding 10,000 videos = ~2MB
   - Still well within browser limits

### Performance Considerations

1. **Page Load**: Fast, only loads metadata
2. **Video Playback**: YouTube handles streaming
3. **Switching Videos**: Only loads new embed, old one is garbage collected
4. **No Memory Leaks**: Player properly unloads videos

### Conclusion

The vault is extremely lightweight and will NOT use significant memory over time because:
- It only stores text metadata, not videos
- YouTube handles all video streaming
- Browser garbage collection cleans up old embeds
- LocalStorage has plenty of space for thousands of entries

You could add videos daily for years without any performance impact!
